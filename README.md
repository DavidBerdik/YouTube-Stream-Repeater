# YouTube Stream Repeater
YouTube Stream Repeater is a stripped down version of the [youtube-dl-web](https://github.com/xxcodianxx/youtube-dl-web) project which entirely removes the web UI component and leaves only the API endpoint. This stripped down version of the server is intended for anyone who wishes to host an endpoint that will be used only for playing streams on devices that are not "YouTube friendly" and therefore do not need the web UI component. For example, I am using this modified version to host an endpoint through which I can reliably stream audio from YouTube videos to my Alexa Smart Speaker.
